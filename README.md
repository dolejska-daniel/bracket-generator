The easiest way to get this library is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). While
having Composer installed it takes only `composer require dolejska-daniel/bracket-generator`
and `composer update` to get the library up and ready!

If you are not fan of Composer, you can download [whole repository in .zip archive](https://github.com/dolejska-daniel/bracket-generator/archive/master.zip)
or clone the repository using Git - `git clone https://github.com/dolejska-daniel/bracket-generator`.
_But in this case, you will have to create your own autoload function._
